/**
 * Converts an ascii encoded string to trytes.
 *
 * ### How conversion works:
 *
 * An ascii value of `1 Byte` can be represented in `2 Trytes`:
 *
 * 1. We get the decimal unicode value of an individual ASCII character.
 *
 * 2. From the decimal value, we then derive the two tryte values by calculating the tryte equivalent
 * (e.g.: `100` is expressed as `19 + 3 * 27`), given that tryte alphabet contains `27` trytes values:
 *   a. The first tryte value is the decimal value modulo `27` (which is the length of the alphabet).
 *   b. The second value is the remainder of `decimal value - first value` devided by `27`.
 *
 * 3. The two values returned from Step 2. are then input as indices into the available
 * trytes alphabet (`9ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`), to get the correct tryte value.
 *
 * ### Example:
 *
 * Lets say we want to convert ascii character `Z`.
 *
 * 1. `Z` has a decimal unicode value of `90`.
 *
 * 2. `90` can be represented as `9 + 3 * 27`. To make it simpler:
 *   a. First value is `90 % 27 = 9`.
 *   b. Second value is `(90 - 9) / 27 = 3`.
 *
 * 3. Our two values are `9` and `3`. To get the tryte value now we simply insert it as indices
 * into the tryte alphabet:
 *   a. The first tryte value is `'9ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'[9] = I`
 *   b. The second tryte value is `'9ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'[3] = C`
 *
 * Therefore ascii character `Z` is represented as `IC` in trytes.
